<h1 class="header">Brian's unpretty On Demand deck builder and shuffler.</h1>

    <div id="container">
        <p>Below is all the listed cards in the deck, in order.</p>

        <p>First thing - Pick a card, any card: (Random selection 1 out of 52)</P>

        <p>I have chosen <span id="pickedCard">(picked card)</span>

                                                <button onclick="getShuffle()">Shuffle</button>

                        <p>Shuffled deck as objects:</p>
                        <p id="shuffledDeckObjects">Double check the deck is complete after shuffling - visually</p>

                        <p>Finally, this is what the shuffled deck looks like:</p>
                        <p id="shuffledDeckCards">Shuffled Deck with names</p>
                        <HR>
                        <P>Let's grab a "poker hand" from the first five shuffled cards</p>
                        <button onclick="grabPokerHand()">Get Poker Hand</button>
                        <p id="pokerHandObjects"></p>

                        <p id="evald"></p>
                        <P>What's the specific rank (as an object?)
                        <P id="ranking">Is it a...</P>
                        <P>What's the specific rank (as a poker player would refer to it?)
                        <P id="rankingName">Is it a...</P>
                        <HR>
                        <P>At this point, I might go back and clean up the code after talking to some people who gave me some tricks, like using array.slice() to copy arrays by value, or putting functions inside an array. (My response, You can DO that?!)<p>

                        <p>Important: this form takes poker hands in the form "AsTs9h3c4d" - a real end-user input would likely use toggleboxes &amp; jQuery - but one thing at a time. There's no errorcatching here.</p>
